                SB Admin 2 makes extensive use of Bootstrap 4 utility
                classes in order to reduce CSS bloat and poor page
                performance. Custom CSS classes are used to create custom
                components and custom utility classes.

                Before working with this theme, you should become familiar
                with the Bootstrap framework, especially the utility
                classes.
